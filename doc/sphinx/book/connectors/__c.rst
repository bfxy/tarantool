Here is a complete C program that inserts :code:`[99999,'B']` into
space :code:`examples` via the high-level C API.

.. code-block:: c

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <tarantool/tarantool.h>
    #include <tarantool/tnt_net.h>
    #include <tarantool/tnt_opt.h>
    void main()
    {
     struct tnt_stream *tnt = tnt_net(NULL);          /* See note = SETUP */
     tnt_set(tnt, TNT_OPT_URI, "localhost:3301");
     if (tnt_connect(tnt) < 0)                        /* See note = CONNECT */
       { printf("Connection refused\n"); exit(-1); }
     struct tnt_stream *tuple = tnt_object(NULL);     /* See note = MAKE REQUEST */
     tnt_object_format(tuple, "[%d%s]", 999, "B");
     tnt_insert(tnt, 999, tuple);                     /* See note = SEND REQUEST */
     tnt_flush(tnt);
     struct tnt_reply reply;  tnt_reply_init(&reply); /* See note = GET REPLY */
     tnt->read_reply(tnt, &reply);
     if (reply.code != 0)
       { printf("Insert failed %lu.\n", reply.code); }
     tnt_close(tnt);                                  /* See below = TEARDOWN */
     tnt_stream_free(tuple);
     tnt_stream_free(tnt);
    }

To prepare, paste the code into a file named example.c and install
tarantool-c. One way to install tarantool-c (using Ubuntu) is:

| :codenormal:`$` :codebold:`git clone git://github.com/tarantool/tarantool-c.git ~/tarantool-c`
| :codenormal:`$` :codebold:`cd tarantool-c`
| :codenormal:`$` :codebold:`git submodule init`
| :codenormal:`$` :codebold:`git submodule update`
| :codenormal:`$` :codebold:`cmake .`
| :codenormal:`$` :codebold:`make`
| :codenormal:`$` :codebold:`make install`

To compile and link the program, say: 

| :codenormal:`$ # sometimes this is necessary:`
| :codenormal:`$` :codebold:`export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib`
| :codenormal:`$` :codebold:`gcc -o example example.c -ltarantool -ltarantoolnet`

Before trying to run, 
check that the server is listening and that :code:`examples` exists, as :ref:`described earlier <connector-setting>`.
To run the program, say :code:`./example`. The program will connect
to the server, and will send the request.
If tarantool is not running on localhost with listen address = 3301, the program will print “Connection refused”.
If the insert fails, the program will print "Insert failed" and an error number.

Here are notes corresponding to comments in the example program.

**SETUP:** The setup begins by creating a stream.
In this program the stream will be named :code:`tnt`.
Before connecting on the tnt stream, some options may have to be set.
The most important option is TNT_OPT_URI.
In this program the URI is "localhost:3301", since that is where the
Tarantool server is supposed to be listening. |br|
Function description: :samp:`struct tnt_stream *tnt_net(struct tnt_stream *s);` |br|
Function description: :samp:`int tnt_set(struct tnt_stream *s, int option, variant option-value);`

**CONNECT:** Now that the stream named :codenormal:`tnt` exists and is associated with a
URI, this example program can connect to the server. |br|
Function description: :samp:`int tnt_connect(struct tnt_stream *s);` |br|
The connect might fail for a variety of reasons, such as:
the server is not running, or the URI contains an invalid password.
If the connect fails, the return value will be -1.

**MAKE REQUEST:** Most requests require passing a structured value, such as
the contents of a tuple. In this program the request will
be an insert, and the tuple contents will be an integer
and a string. This is a simple serial set of values, that
is, there are no sub-structures or arrays. Therefore it
is easy in this case to format what will be passed using
the same sort of arguments that one would use with a C
printf() function: "%d" for the integer, "%s" for the string,
then the integer value, then a pointer to the string value. |br|
Function description: :samp:`ssize_t tnt_object_format(struct tnt_stream *s, const char *fmt, ...)`

**SEND REQUEST:** The database-manipulation requests are analogous to the 
requests in the box library. |br|
Function description: :samp:`tnt_insert(struct tnt_stream *s, uint32_t space, struct tnt_stream *tuple);` |br|
Function description: :samp:`tnt_replace(struct tnt_stream *s, uint32_t space, struct tnt_stream *tuple);` |br|
Function description: :samp:`tnt_select(struct tnt_stream *s, uint32_t space, uint32_t index, uint32_t limit, uint32_t offset, uint8_t iterator, struct tnt_stream *key);` |br|
Function description: :samp:`ssize_t tnt_update(struct tnt_stream *s, uint32_t space, uint32_t index, struct tnt_stream *key, struct tnt_stream *ops);` |br|
In this program the choice is to do an insert request, so
the program passes the tnt_stream that was used for connection
(:code:`tnt`) and the stream that was set up with tnt_object_format (:code:`tuple`).

**GET REPLY:** For most requests the client will receive a reply containing some indication
whether the result was successful, and a set of tuples.
This program checks for success but does not decode the rest of the reply. |br|
Function description: :samp:`struct tnt_reply *tnt_reply_init(struct tnt_reply *r);` |br|
Function description: :samp:`tnt->read_reply(struct tnt_stream *s, struct tnt_reply *r);` |br|
Function description: :samp:`void tnt_reply_free(struct tnt_reply *r);`

**TEARDOWN:** When a session ends, the connection that was made with 
tnt_connect() should be closed and the objects that were made in the setup
should be destroyed. |br|
Function description: :samp:`tnt_close(struct tnt_stream *s);` |br|
Function description: :samp:`tnt_stream_free(struct tnt_stream *s);`

The example program only shows one request and does not show all that's
necessary for good practice. For that, see http://github.com/tarantool/tarantool-c.
